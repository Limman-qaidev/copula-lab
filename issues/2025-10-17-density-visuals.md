# 2025-10-17 â€“ Revise pseudo-observation visuals

## Summary
- the Data tab displayed stacked scatter plots and histograms that were hard to interpret for higher dimensions
- Study page images expanded to full width, making on-screen analysis uncomfortable

## Resolution
- replaced the U scatter/histogram outputs with a square density matrix grid capped to five dimensions for clarity
- tightened study figure generation and added responsive image rendering helpers so assets render at a consistent size across tabs
